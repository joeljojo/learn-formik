# Handling forms using Formik

Formik library provides efficiency, performance, and easier form handling.


Formik enables easier form value handling, input validation, and error reporting on inputs.

You can find out more about form Handling using Formik [here](https://formik.org/docs/overview)


You can also learn how to easily handle validations using `validationSchema` provided by the [Yup]() library. The `validationSchema is passed to `useFormik()` as a prop and it simplifies the validation process.
